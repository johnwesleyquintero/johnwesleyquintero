## **Current Project: A SaaS-like Platform for the (Slightly) Obsessed Amazon Seller**

I'm not gonna lie, I'm on a quest – a quest to conquer the Amazon data jungle and build a **scalable SaaS-like platform** that will help you, Amazon brand managers, not just survive, but *thrive*! This tool is designed to take the pain out of reporting and analysis, so you can focus on the good stuff (like boosting sales).

### **Key Features I'm Hustling To Build**

- **📂 CSV File Automation (aka, 'The Data Tamer'):**
  *  Taming those wild CSV files, making sure your reports are clean, processed and ready to go.
- **📊 Data Cleaning and Aggregation (aka, 'The Mess Cleaner'):**
  * Handling all the messy, inconsistent data, and getting them in order, so all the metrics will make sense.
- **📈 Automated Metrics Calculation (aka, 'The Insight Generator'):**
  * Calculating all your most important metrics, so you do not have to waste your time with complicated formulas.
- **🔍 Keyword Analyzer and ASIN Insights (aka, 'The Target Finder'):**
   * Using every single bit of information you give me to make sure I can find the keywords and ASIN that can get you the most results.
- **📋 Competitor Benchmarking (aka, 'The Spyglass'):**
    *  See what your competitors are up to, so that you are always ahead of the game.
- **📤 Export Clean Data (aka, 'The Quick Exit'):**
     * Getting you clean data, that you can quickly use in other BI tools.
- **📋 Custom Reporting (aka, 'Your Personal Analyst'):**
      * Providing all the insights you need, and a path to take for maximum results.

### Acknowledgments (aka, 'My Real MVPs')

This project framework was enhanced with valuable support and insights from [Hayabusa](https://gemini.google.com/app), also with the help of [Brother_Wizard](https://openai.com/chatgpt) and [Hayabusa](https://gemini.google.com/app)'s little "sister" [Natalia](https://script.google.com/home), helping refine and optimize the development strategy. *And also I got to create a crazy story out of it, lets be honest!*
