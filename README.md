### **Key Features**

  Standardize and clean data by handling missing values, renaming columns, converting data types, and removing duplicates.  

- **📈 Performance Metrics Calculation**:  
  Automatically calculate key performance metrics like CTR, CVR, ACoS, ROAS, and AOV to visualize campaign effectiveness.  

- **🔍 Keyword Analyzer and ASIN Mapping**:  
  Optimize keyword strategies with detailed performance analysis and map search queries to ASINs for better targeting.  

- **📋 Data Aggregation**:  
  Aggregate campaign and query data across dimensions like Date, Week, Month, Quarter, and Year for deeper insights.
