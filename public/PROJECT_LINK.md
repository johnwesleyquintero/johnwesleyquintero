Okay, absolutely! Let's implement the GitHub Action to automatically update your "Featured Projects" section based on your pinned repositories.

Here's the full implementation:

Step 1: Modify your README.md

You need to add special comment markers around the section you want to automatically update. The script will look for these markers and replace everything between them.

Edit your README.md file (the one in the root of your johnwesleyquintero/johnwesleyquintero repository) and change the "Featured Projects" section like this:

markdown
## âœ¨ Featured Projects

<!-- START_PROJECT_LIST -->
*This section is automatically updated based on my pinned repositories. Manual changes will be overwritten.*
<!-- END_PROJECT_LIST -->

---

## ðŸ“ˆ GitHub Stats
Replace the existing list of projects (My Portfolio, SellSmart Hub, etc.) with these two comment lines and the placeholder text in between.
The content between <!-- START_PROJECT_LIST --> and <!-- END_PROJECT_LIST --> will be replaced by the script.
Step 2: Create the GitHub Actions Workflow File

In your special profile repository (johnwesleyquintero/johnwesleyquintero on GitHub), create a new directory path: .github/workflows/
Inside the workflows directory, create a new file named update_readme_projects.yml (or any other .yml name you prefer).
Paste the following code into update_readme_projects.yml:
yaml
name: Update Pinned Projects in README

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Runs on a schedule (every 6 hours in this example)
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *' # Runs at minute 0 past every 6th hour. Adjust as needed.
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-readme:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Grant permissions for the workflow to read repo contents and write them back
    permissions:
      contents: write

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Setup GitHub CLI needed for gh api command
      - name: Set up GitHub CLI
        run: |
          type -p curl >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y)
          curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
          && sudo chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
          && echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
          && sudo apt update \
          && sudo apt install gh -y
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Use the default GitHub token provided to the runner

      # Fetch pinned repositories using GitHub CLI and format them into Markdown
      - name: Fetch Pinned Repos and Generate Markdown
        id: generate_list
        run: |
          # Use GitHub CLI's GraphQL API to get pinned items (up to 6 repositories)
          # Adjust 'first: 6' if you want to show more or fewer pinned repos
          pinned_repos_json=$(gh api graphql -f query='
            query($login: String!) {
              user(login: $login) {
                pinnedItems(first: 6, types: REPOSITORY) {
                  nodes {
                    ... on Repository {
                      name

          # Use jq to format the JSON into Markdown list items
          # This creates a simple list format. You can customize the Markdown here.
          markdown_list=$(echo "$pinned_repos_json" | jq -r '.[] |
            "### ðŸ“Œ [\("." + .name)](\(.url))\n" +

          # Check if the README file has unstaged changes
          if ! git diff --quiet README.md; then
            echo "README.md changed. Committing and pushing..."
            git add README.md
            git commit -m "Automated: Update pinned projects in README"
            git push
          else

Step 3: Pin Your Repositories

Go to your main GitHub profile page (https://github.com/johnwesleyquintero).
In the top right section, find "Pinned" and click "Customize your pins".
Select the repositories you want to feature (up to 6 will be shown by the script above). Choose the ones that best represent your work (like your Portfolio, SellSmart Hub, SellSmart Docs, DevFlowDB, etc.).
Click "Save pins".
Step 4: Commit and Push

Commit the changes you made:
The modified README.md file.
The new .github/workflows/update_readme_projects.yml file.
Push these changes to your johnwesleyquintero/johnwesleyquintero repository on GitHub.
How it Works:

Trigger: The workflow runs automatically every 6 hours (schedule) or when you manually trigger it from the "Actions" tab of your profile repository (workflow_dispatch).
Checkout: It downloads a copy of your profile repository code.
Setup gh: It installs the GitHub Command Line Interface.
Fetch & Format: It uses gh api graphql to ask GitHub for your pinned repositories. It specifically requests the name, description, URL, star count, primary language, and homepage URL (if set). It then uses the jq tool to format this information into Markdown headings and list items. It includes a link to the "Live Demo/Docs" using the homepageUrl if you've set one in the repository settings (the "Website" field on the repo's main page).
Inject: It reads your README.md, finds the <!-- START_PROJECT_LIST --> and <!-- END_PROJECT_LIST --> comments, and replaces everything between them with the Markdown generated in the previous step.
Commit & Push: It checks if the README.md file was actually changed. If it was, it commits the changes using a generic bot user and pushes the updated README.md back to your repository.
Now, whenever you change your pinned repositories on GitHub, this action will automatically update the "Featured Projects" section in your profile README within a few hours (or when you manually run the action).
